Awake! for Morning in the
Bowl of Night
Has flung the Stone that puts the
Stars to Flight:
And Lo! the Hunter of the
East has caught
The Sultan's Turret in a 'Noose
of Light.

Dreaming when Dawn's Left
Hand was in the Sky
I heard a Voice within the Tavern
cry,
"Awake, my Little ones, and
fill the Cup
Before Life's Liquor in its Cup
be dry."
And, as the Cock crew, those
who stood before
The Tavern shouted - "Open
then the Door!
You know how little while we
have to stay,
And, once departed, may return
no more. "

Now the New Year reviving old
Desires,
The thoughtful Soul to Solitude
retires,
Where the WHITE HAND OF
MOSES on the Bough
Puts out, and Jesus from the
Ground suspires.
Iram indeed is gone with all its
Rose,
And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup
where no one knows;
But still the Vine her ancient
Ruby yields,
And still a Garden by the Water
blows.

And David's Lips are lock't;
but in divine
High'piping Pehlevi, with
"Wine! Wine! Wine!
Red Wine! "-the Nightingale
cries to the Rose
That yellow Cheek of hers t'
incarnadine.
Come, fill the Cup, and in the
Fire of Spring
The Winter Garment of Repen'
tance fling:
The Bird of Time has but a
little way
To fly-and Lo! the Bird is on
the Wing.

And look - a thousand Blos-
soms with the Day
Woke-and a thousand scatter'd
into Clay:
And this first Summer Month
that brings the Rose
Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad
away.
But come with old Khayyam,
and leave the Lot
Of Kaikobad and Kaikhosru for'
got:
Let Rustum lay about him as
he will,
Or Hatim Tai cry Supper-
heed them not.

With me along some Strip of
Herbage strown
That just divides the desert from
the sown,
Where name of Slave and
Sultan scarce is known,
And pity Sultan Mahmud on his
Throne.
Here with a Loaf of Bread be-
neath the Bough,
A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse
-and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wil-
derness-
And Wilderness is Paradise
enow.

"How sweet is mortal Sov-
ranty !" -think some:
Others - "How blest the Para-
dise to come!"
Ah, take the Cash in hand and
waive the Rest;
Oh, the brave Music of a distant
Drum!
Look to the Rose that blows
about us-"Lo,
Laughing," she says, "into the
World I blow:
At once the silken Tassel of my
Purse
Tear, and its Treasure on the
Garden throw."

The Wordly Hope men set their
Hearts upon
Turns Ashes or its prospers;
and anon,
Like Snow upon the Desert's
dusty Face
Lighting a little Hour or two-
is gone.
And those who husbanded the
Golden Grain,
And those who flung it to the
Winds like Rain,
Alike to no such aureate Earth
are turn'd
As, buried once, Men want dug
up again.

Think, in this batter'd Caravan-
serai
Whose Doorways are alternate
Night and Day,
How Sultan after Sultan with
his Pomp
Abode his Hour or two, and went
his way.
They say the Lion and the
Lizard keep
The Courts where Jamshyd glor-
ied and drank deep:
And Bahram, that great Hunter
-the Wild Ass
Stamps o'er his Head, and he lies
fast asleep.

I sometimes think that never
blows so red
The Rose as where some buried
Caesar bled;
That every Hyacinth the Gar-
den wears
Dropt in its Lap from some once
lovely Head.
And this delightful Herb whose
tender Green
Fledges the River's Lip on which
we lean-
Ah, lean upon it lightly! for
who knows
From what once lovely Lip it
springs unseen!

Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup
that clears
To-day of past Regrets and future
Fears-
tomorow? - Why, To-mor-
row I may be
Myself with Yesterday's Sev'n
Thousand Years.
Lo! some we loved, the loveliest
and best
That Time and Fate of all their
Vintage prest,
Have drunk their Cup a Round
or two before,
And one by one crept silently to
Rest.

And we, that now make merry
in the Room
They left, and Summer dresses in
new Bloom,
Ourselves must we beneath the
Couch of Earth
Descend, ourselves to make a
Couch-for whom?
Ah, make the most of what we
yet may spend,
Before we too into the Dust de-
scend;
Dust, to lie,
Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer
Dust into Dust, and under
and-sans End!

Alike for those who for To-day
prepare,
And those that after a To-morrow
stare,
A Muezzin from the Tower of
Darkness cries
"Fools! your Reward is neither
Here nor There!
Why, all the Saints and Sages
who discuss'd
Of the Two Worlds so learnedly,
are thrust
Like foolish Prophets forth;
their Words to Scorn
Are scatter'd, and their Mouths
are stopt with Dust.

Oh, come with old Khayyam,
and leave the Wise
To talk; one thing is certain, that
Life flies;
One thing is certain, and the
Rest is Lies;
The Flower that once has blown
for ever dies.
Myself when young did eagerly
frequent
Doctor and Saint, and heard great
Argument
About it and about: but ever-
more
Came out by the same Door as in
I went.

With them the Seed of Wisdom
did I sow,
And with my own hand labour'd
it to grow:
And this was all the Harvest
that I reap'd-
"I came like Water, and like Wind
I go."
Into this Universe, and why not
knowing,
Nor whence, like Water willy-nilly
flowing:
And out of it, as Wind along
the Waste,
I know not whither, willy-nilly
blowing.

What, without asking, hither
hurried whence?
And, without asking, whither
hurried hence?
Another and another Cup to
drown
The Memory of this Impertin-
ence!

Up from Earth's Centre through
the Seventh Gate 
I rose, and on the Throne of
Saturn sate,
And many Knots unravel'd by
the Road;
But not the Knot of Human Death
and Fate.

There was a Door to which I
found no Key:
There was a Veil past which I
could not see:
Some little Talk awhile of ME
and THEE
There seem'd-and then no more
. of THEE and ME.
Then to the rolling Heav' n itself
I cried,
Asking, "What Lamp had Destiny
to guide
Her little Children stumbling in
the Dark?"
And-" A blind Understanding!"
Heav'n replied.

Then to this earthen Bowl did
I adjourn
My Lip the Secret Well of Life
to learn:
And Lip to Lip it murmur'd-
"While you live
Drink! - for once dead you
never shall return."
I think the Vessel, that with
fugitive
Articulation answer'd, once did
live,
And merry-make; and the cold
Lip I kiss'd
How many Kisses might it take
-and give!

For in the Market-place, one
Dusk of Day,
I watch'd the Potter thumping his
wet Clay:
And with its all obliterated
Tongue
It murmur'd - "Gently, Brother,
gently, pray!"
Ah, fill the Cup: -what boots
It to repeat
How Time is slipping underneath
our Feet:
Unborn To-morrow, and dead
yesterday,
Why fret about them if To'day
be sweet!

One Moment in Annihilation's
Waste,
One Moment, of the Well of Life
to taste-
The Stars are setting and the
Caravan
Starts for the Dawn of Nothing
-Oh, make haste!
How long, how long, in infinite
Pursuit
Of This and That endeavour
and dispute?
Better be merry with the fruit-
ful Grape
Than sadden after none, or bitter,
Fruit.

you know, my Friends, how long
since in my House
For a new Marriage I did make
Carouse:
Divorced old barren Reason
from my Bed,
And took the Daughter of the
Vine to Spouse.
For "is" and "is-not" though
with Rule and Line,
And 'Up-And-Down' without, I
could define,
I yet in all I only ~ared to
know,
Was never deep in anything but
-Wine.

And lately, by the Tavern Door
agape,
Came stealing through the Dusk
an Angel Shape
Bearing a Vessel on his Shoul-
der; and
He bid me taste of it; and 'twas
-the Grape!
The Grape that can with Logic
absolute
The Two-and-Seventy jarring
Sects confute:
The subtle Alchemist that in a
Trice
Lifet s leaden Metal into Gold
transmute.

The mighty Mahmud, the vic-
torious Lord,
That all the misbelieving and
black Horde
Of Fears and Sorrows that in-
fest the Soul
Scatters and slays with his enchanted
Sword.
But leave the Wise to wrangle,
and with me
The Quarrel of the Universe let
be:
And, in some corner of the Hub-
bub coucht,
Make Game of that which makes
as much of Thee.

For in and out, above, about,
below,
'Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-
show,
Play'd in a Box whose Candle
is the Sun,
Round which we Phantom Figures
come and go.
And if the Wine you drink, the
Lip you press,
End in the Nothing all Things
end in -Yes-
Then fancy while Thou art,
Thou art but what
Thou shalt be -Nothing- Thou
shalt not be less.



While the Rose blows along the
River Brink,
With old Khayyam the Ruby
Vintage drink:
And when the Angel with his
darker Draught
Draws up to Thee-take that,
and do not shrink.
'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights
and Days
Where Destiny with Men for
Pieces plays:
Hither and thither moves, and
mates, and slays,
And one by one back in the Closet
lays.

The Ball no Question makes of
Ayes and Noes,
But Right or Left as strikes the
Player goes;
And He that toss'd Thee down
into the Field,
He knows about it all- HE knows
-HE knows!
The Moving Finger writes; and,
having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor
Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half
a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a
Word of it.

And that inverted Bowl we call
The Sky,
Whereunder crawling coopt we
live and die,
Lift not thy hands to It for help
-for It
Rolls impotently on as Thou
or I.
With Earth's first Clay They did
the Last Man's knead,
And then of the Last Harvest
sow'd the Seed:
Yea, the first Morning of Crea-
tion wrote
What the Last Dawn of Reckon-
ing shall read.

I tell Thee this-When, starting
from the Goal,
·Over the shoulders of the flaming
Foal
Of Heav'n Parwin and Mush-
tara they flung,
In my predestin'd Plot of Dust
and Soul
The Vine had struck a Fibre;
which about
If clings my Being-let the Sufi
flout;
Of my Base Metal may be filed
a Key,
That shall unlock the Door he
howls without.

And this I know: whether the
one True Light
Kindle to Love, or Wrath consume
me quite,
One glimpse of It within the
Tavern caught
Better than in the Temple lost
outright.
Oh, Thou, who didst with Pitfall
and with Gin
Beset the Road I was to wander
in,
Thou wilt not with Predestina-
tion round
Enmesh me, and impute my Fall
to Sin?

Oh, Thou, who Man of baser
Earth didst make,
And. who with Eden didst devise
the Snake;
For all the Sin wherewith the
Face of Man
Is blacken'd, Man's Forgiveness
give-and take! 

Listen again. One Evening at the
Close
Of Ramazan, ere the better Moon
arose,
In that old Potter's Shop I
stood alone
With the clay Population round
in Rows.
And, strange to tell, among that
Earthen Lot
Some could articulate, while others
not:
And suddenly one more impa-
tient cried-
"Who is the Potter, pray, and who
the Pot?"

Then said another -"Surely not
in vain
My Substance from the common
Earth was ta' en,
That He who subtly wrought
me into Shape
Should stamp me back to common
Earth again."
Another said-"Why, ne'er a
peevish Boy
Would break the Bowl from
which he drank in Joy;
Shall He that made the Vessel
in pure Love
And Fancy, in an after Rage
destroy !"

None answer'd this; but after
Silence spake
A Vessel of a more ungainly
Make:
"They sneer at me for leaning
all awry;
What! did the Hand then of the
Potter shake?"
Said one - "Folks of a surly
Tapster tell,
And daub his Visage with the
Smoke of Hell;
They talk of some strict Testing
of us- Pish!
He's a Good Fellow, .and 'twill all
be well"

Then said another with a long'
drawn Sigh,
"My Clay with long oblivion is
gone dry:
But, fill me with the old familiar
Juice,
Methinks I might recover by-and-
bye!"
So while the Vessels one by one
were speaking,
One spied the little Crescent all
were seeking:
And then they jogg' d each other,
"Brother! Brother!
Hark to the Porter's Shoulder-knot
a-creaking!"

Ah, with the Grape my fading
Life provide,
And wash my Body whence the
Life has died,
And in a Windingsheet of Vine-
leaf wrapt,
So bury me by some sweet Garden-
side.
That ev' n my buried Ashes such
a Snare
Of Perfume shall fling up into the
Air,
As not a True Believer passing
by
But shall be overtaken unaware.

Indeed, the Idols I have loved so
long
Have done my Credit in Men's
Eye much wrong:
Have drown'd my Honour in a
shallow Cup,
And sold my Reputation for a
Song.
Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft
before
I swore-but was I sober when
I swore?
And then and then came Spring,
and Rose-in-hand
My thread-bare Penitence apieces
tore.

And much as Wine has play'd
the Infidel,
And robb'd me of my Robe of
Honour-well,
I often wonder what the Vint-
ners buy
One half so precious as the Goods
they sell.
Alas, that Spring should vanish
with the Rose!
That Youth's sweet-scented
Manuscript should close!
The Nightingale that in the
Branches sang,
Ah, whence, and whither flown
again, who knows!

Ah Love! could Thou and I
with Fate conspire
To grasp this sorry Scheme of
Things entire,
Would not we shatter it to bits
-and then
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's
Desire!
Ah, Moon of my Delight who
know'st no wane,
The Moon of Heav'n is rising
once again:
How oft hereafter rising shall
she look
Through this same Garden after
me--in vain!

And when Thyself with shining
Foot shall pass
Among the Guests Star-scatter'd
on the Grass,
And in thy joyous Errand reach
the Spot
Where I made one-turn down
an empty Glass!

Tamam shud
